Summary: maxElim Algorithm for Finding Maximal Eliminable Sets
===================================================================

CHANGES MADE:
1. Renamed MaxLinearEliminableSet -> maxElim
2. Changed maxElim to return LIST of maximal eliminable sets
3. Removed preferredSet parameter (user selects from returned list)
4. Updated LinearReduceRHS to use first maximal set automatically
5. Added to testRed.nb to demonstrate usage

ALGORITHM (red.wl):
- greedyElim[RN, rts, U0]: Greedy elimination starting from U0
- maxElim[RN, rts]: Find multiple maximal sets by trying different orderings
  * Returns list of truly maximal sets (not contained in others)
  * Uses heuristic (may not find ALL possible maximal sets)

USAGE in testRed.nb:
1. Find all maximal sets: allMaxElim = maxElim[RN, rts]
2. User selects which set to eliminate: Uselected = {"e","estar","y1","y2"}
3. Proceed with reduction using selected set

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Ping-Pong Bi-Bi):
Found 2 maximal set(s):
  [1] {e}                           - just enzyme E
  [2] {p1, p2, s1, s2, y1, y2}      - substrates/products/intermediates

User can also verify custom set {e,estar,y1,y2} satisfies FSW conditions
and use it for biochemically meaningful reduction.

FILES:
- red.wl: Contains maxElim, greedyElim functions
- maxElim.wl: Helper functions (LinearSpecies, MaximalEliminableSubsets)
- testRed.nb: Demonstrates maxElim in ping-pong example
- testMaxElim.nb: Standalone test of maximal set finder

NOTE: Finding ALL maximal eliminable sets is computationally hard (NP-complete).
The heuristic approach finds several representative maximal sets efficiently.
For specific applications, users should verify FSW conditions for their
preferred elimination set.
